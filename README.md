### Problem Statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Insights

The dashboard Provide Insights to the Revenue Team in Hospitality Domain:
1. Developed 4 Dashboards for Overall Analysis, Revenue Analysis, Booking Analysis, and Rating Analysis.
2. The analysis is done on various parameters to give a proper insight from the requirement mentioned by the revenue team.
3. We need to focus more on Elite customers across the cities as they drive the revenue boost. RT2 Room type should be prioritized more as it has the highest influence on revenue.
4. We should make a good connection with the make your trip and log trip platforms. The last two weekends should be in focus to create a balance in realized revenue.
5. Revenue started trending down in the last 4days of the month, falling by 28.17%.
